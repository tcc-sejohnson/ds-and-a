# Algorithmic Toolbox

This is a basic class I'm taking for fun from UC Berkeley. 

The grading software requires that I submit all of my code in one `main.go` file, so there's very little avenue to share code between files. On account of this, you'll see a lot of copy-pasting of code that you wouldn't see in my work otherwise.
